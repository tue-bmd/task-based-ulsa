### Additional Results

Here we provide an extended set of results to supplement those presented in the paper. In particular, we show results on additional downstream tasks using the EchoNetLVH model, and include the uniform random sampling strategy as an additional baseline. It is clear in the figure below that the task-based information gain strategy outperforms baselines across each of the EchoNetLVH measurement tasks.
